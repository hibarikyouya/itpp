Please, execute ./odjo.py to display the usage.

A search will create :
	-*- a "pdb_and_png" directory that will contain PDB and PNG files
	-*- a "graph.png" file
	-*- a "matrix.csv" file

WARNING ! For each new search, the "graph.png" and "matrix.csv" files will be
overwritten... :/

The "odjo" directory contains the program.
The "xml" directory contains XML files for the requests to the rcsb server.

COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONS :
The "list.txt" and "bcl2_family.txt" are here to allow you test the program.
The Bio.PDB module always create a new "obsolete"... :/
The "rapport.pdf" file is the report.
